Frame/State Hardcodings in Doom/Boom
====================================

Frame 0:
	NULL State. Reserved.
	Any object that jumps to this frame is removed.

Frame 1:
	STOP State for weapons that reset player light level boost. 
	Reserved for convenience.

Frame 52:
	Chaingun first firing state.

Chaingun Muzzle Flash:
	The chaingun's muzzle flash is [FlashFrame] and [FlashFrame]+1 on 
	subsequent calls to A_FireCGun, offset from State 52. So, if called from 
	state 52, [FlashFrame]. If state 53, [FlashFrame]+1.

Frame 67:
	If A_WeaponReady is called on this frame while the chainsaw is the active
	weapon, the chainsaw sound is played.

Frame 91:
	Blood map object is set to this frame for a bleeding hitscan attack that 
	does between 9 to 12 damage, inclusive.

Frame 92:
	Blood map object is set to this frame for a bleeding hitscan attack that 
	does strictly less than 9 damage.

Frame 154:
	The player's firing frame on weapon fire.

Frame 155:
	The player's firing frame if a call to A_GunFlash happens directly, or 
	indirectly via some weapon action functions.

Frame 266:
	An actor that calls A_VileChase and encounters a dead object with a Raise 
	frame jumps to this frame on "heal".

Frames 477-489 (inclusive):
	On Fast Monsters, these frames get their duration halved.

Frame 799:
	For A_BrainExplode, a Rocket Projectile (Slot 34) is spawned, but 
	immediately set to frame 799. It would be wise to then call A_BrainExplode
	at the end to make the next explosion occur at the end of the animation.

Frame 895:
	All actors are set to this state when their corpse is crushed.

Plasma Muzzle Flash:
	The plasma rifle's muzzle flash is called at random between [FlashFrame] 
	and [FlashFrame]+1 on a call to A_FirePlasma.

Final Frame:
	If replaced in a DEH patch, using DeHackEd to patch an original EXE will 
	overwrite the weapon table, due to a bug in DeHackEd 3.0 (this is fine 
	in source ports).


More State Stuff
================

The [SpawnState] state on every thing is SET instead of updated via Thinker
update, which means that it's action pointer will not be called. The state
will also NOT ADVANCE if the duration of that frame is 0 or less.
