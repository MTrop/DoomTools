; This file is the texture listing for the TEXTURE1 lump (plus PNAMES).
;
; Use ";" to make comment lines.
; This is also compatible with DEUTEX!
;
; Example definition:
;
; TEXNAME W H
; * PATCHNAM X Y
; ...

; NOTE: If you intend to use this for adding to an IWAD's texture set,
; you will need to add the texture definitions from the IWAD here, or they
; will not be available when to compile the project together.

; You can rebuild this file from the project's IWAD by running:
; doommake rebuildtextures
; ... but only if you delete this file (and texture2.txt). 

; First texture is the NULL texture.
