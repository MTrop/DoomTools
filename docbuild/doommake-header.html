				Alright, everybody. I've been <em>hearing things.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				I've been hearing that you are slapping together Doom projects all willy-nilly and kvetching about needing to 
				pare back the textures used for the final product. I've been hearing that you've been wanting to get into MBF21 
				and/or DSDHACKED development, but the patch building is just one tiny piece of the puzzle. I've been hearing about 
				some of you that manage your projects in <em>single WADs</em> and making one point of failure for your magnum opus, 
				and perhaps need some kind of repository-driven solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				I hear you need a <strong>better way.</strong> Well, guess what? That "better way" <em>exists!</em>
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				What if I told you that you could do all of those things in <em>one command?</em> You'd say I was crazy. 
				But you can. Enter <strong>DoomMake.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>DoomMake</strong> is a project builder for Doom mods. It's a program that builds a file system 
				scaffolding where you throw everything in the correct directories and your wonderful WAD file pops out! 
				Whether you are making something by yourself or with others, DoomMake does the heavy lifting when it comes 
				time to package up your work before you send it out into the world!
			</p>
			<p>
				"Heavy lifting," I might add, that includes <strong><em>exporting only the map textures necessary to play 
					your mod, so that you don't have to do that manually!</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				<u><strong>The Most Common Project</strong></u>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, a lot of y'all are gonna be like, "Matt, you're a handsome, charismatic dreamboat, but what you are 
				promising can't possibly be that easy." Well, aside from the parts where I'm a handsome, charismatic dreamboat, 
				you're <strong>wrong.</strong> It IS that easy!
			</p>
			<p>
				The most common kind of project is gonna be one with <strong>maps,</strong> <strong>loose assets,</strong> 
				and <strong>textures from a texture WAD,</strong> right? DoomMake's got you covered. Type this at the command 
				line to make that initial project structure:
			</p>
			
			<pre class="ipsCode">doommake myproject --new-project assets texturewads maps</pre>
			
			<p>
				Then you'll have to answer some quick questions:
			</p>
			
			<pre class="ipsCode">
What is your project's WAD name (blank for "PROJECT")? SOMEJUNK
Path to project IWAD (blank to skip)? H:\Doom\IWADs\DOOM2.WAD</pre>
			
			<p>
				And then after some stuff gets generated, you'll see this in your project directory that was just created:
			</p>
			<p class="w3-center">
				<img class="w3-image" src="images/doommake/PIC1.png" style="width:812px;height:auto;" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Those files and folders are the main scaffolding of your project. Those <strong>.script</strong> 
				and <strong>.properties</strong> files are what drive the DoomMake build process. Everything is 
				editable! If you update DoomMake itself (via DoomTools updates), your project's build will still work!
			</p>
			<p>
				See that <strong>/src</strong> folder? Let's take a look inside!
			</p>
			<p class="w3-center">
				<img class="w3-image" src="images/doommake/PIC2.png" />
			</p>
			<p>
				Change that <strong>wadinfo.txt</strong>. That becomes your text file (and is imported as <strong>WADINFO</strong> in the final WAD file).
			</p>
			<p>
				Record and maintain project credits in <strong>credits.txt</strong>. That gets imported as <strong>CREDITS</strong> in the final WAD, as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Put (or edit) all of your maps in <strong>/src/maps</strong>. Use your favorite map editor! Only the map WADs are read!
			</p>
			<p>
				Throw your texture WADs in <strong>/src/wads/textures</strong>. You'll use those files for editing maps.
			</p>
			<p>
				You've got a <strong>/src/assets</strong> folder for all of your loose assets:
			</p>
			<p class="w3-center">
				<img class="w3-image" src="images/doommake/PIC3.png" />
			</p>
			<p>
				A place for global-space stuff like DEMOs or GENMIDI or whatever, a place for graphics, music, sprites, or sounds, imported as-is.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <strong>/src/convert</strong> directory will contain graphics, sounds, and sprites that get 
				automatically converted on build.
			</p>
			<p class="w3-center">
				<img class="w3-image" src="images/doommake/PIC4.png" />
			</p>
			<p>
				But how are you going to edit all of those assets and whatnot? Easy! Using SLADE! It's got a directory 
				
				mode! Just open that <strong>/src</strong> directory and you can move stuff in, alter, and save to the project structure!
			</p>
			<p class="w3-center">
				<img class="w3-image" src="images/doommake/PIC5.png" style="width:800px;height:auto;" />
			</p>
			<p>
				And then when you're all done, just jump into your project directory at the command prompt, and type:
			</p>
			
			<pre class="ipsCode">doommake</pre>
			
			<p>
				THAT'S IT!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				DoomMake will then chew through all of your project stuff, spit out some intermediate WAD files in 
				the <strong>/build</strong> directory, and assemble your project as a texture-minified product in the <strong>/dist</strong> directory!
			</p>
			<p class="w3-center">
				<img class="w3-image" src="images/doommake/PIC6.png" style="width:700px;height:auto;" />
			</p>
			<p>
				And there you have it. DoomMake is also smart enough to not rebuild stuff that didn't change, so 
				you can keep rebuilding stuff as you edit other things.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				<u><strong>What else can it do?</strong></u>
			</p>
			<p>
				It also has templates for DECOHack (or other patch utilities), initializing a Git repository for 
				your project (and Mercurial), and even running your project from DoomMake in your favorite source 
				port! And if there's a tiny thing it doesn't support out of the box, you can edit all of the project 
				scripts until it's how you like it.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				<u><strong>What CAN'T it do?</strong></u>
			</p>
			<p>
				Well... it doesn't put together GZDoom and Eternity PK3/PKEs out of the box, yet. But it's coming soon! 
				Just need to figure out the best approach for that sort of thing. Nothing says you can't code that 
				yourself in the DoomMake scripts! DoomTools (and DoomMake) should contain documentation about it.
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>
				<u><strong>Oh. Well, any help for other types of Doom projects?</strong></u>
			</p>
			<p>
				Sure! Here's a webpage for giving you the correct command line for creating the project scaffolding 
				of your dreams, plus a lot of extra information about all the different templates in your project:
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="doommake-quickstart.html">doommake-quickstart.html</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				There's even an example project that you can clone and build yourself using Git! BEHOLD IT'S POWER!

				<u><strong>Who is using DoomMake?</strong></u>
			</p>
			<p>
				All the cool kids are using DoomMake! Prominent authors! Me! Maybe YOU, one day!
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, get out there and MAKE SOMETHING!
