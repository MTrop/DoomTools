====                   Command Line Usage                    ====
=================================================================

Usage: wadmerge [--help | -h | --version]
                [switches] [scriptfile] [arguments]

    --help        Prints help and exits.
    -h

    --version     Prints version, and exits.

[switches]:
    --verbose     Prints verbose output.
    -v

[scriptfile]:
    <filename>    The input script file.

    --            Script input is from Standard In, not a file.

    If a file is not specified, ./wadmerge.txt is the default file.
    The parent directory of the provided script becomes the working directory.

[arguments]:
    The arguments to pass to the script. Script arguments are injected into
    commands by just adding "$" plus the argument index. (e.g. $0) A
    doubled-up $ ($$) is interpreted as one "$".

    The argument index references can be in any part of the parsed tokens, not
    just by themselves as a singular token. They are parsed at the token level,
    not the line level.

    Arguments: ["apple", "banana", "doom stuff"]
    mergedir $1 ./$0/$1phone $2
    Expands to:
    mergedir "banana" "./apple/bananaphone" "doom stuff"

    Returns: OK if a symbol was created.

CREATE [symbol]
    Creates a new in-memory buffer, errors out if the symbol exists.

    Creates a new WAD file (on disk - not in memory), errors out if 
    the symbol exists or the new file could not be created.
    WARNING: If the file already exists, it is OVERWRITTEN!

    incur lots of overhead as the output file grows.
