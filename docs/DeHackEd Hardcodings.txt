Frame/State Hardcodings in Doom/Boom
====================================

Frame 0:
	NULL Frame. Reserved.
	Any object that jumps to this frame is removed.

Frame 1:
	STOP Frame for weapons that reset player light level boost. Reserved for convenience.

Frame 52:
	Chaingun first firing frame.

Chaingun Muzzle Flash:
	The chaingun's muzzle flash is [FlashFrame] and [FlashFrame]+1 on subsequent calls to A_FireCGun offset from Frame 52.
	So, if called from frame 52, [FlashFrame]. If frame 53, [FlashFrame]+1.

Frame 67:
	If A_WeaponReady is called on this frame while the chainsaw is the active weapon, the chainsaw sound is played.

Frame 154:
	The player's firing frame on weapon fire.

Frame 155:
	The player's firing frame if a call to A_GunFlash happens directly, or indirectly via some weapon action functions.

Frame 266:
	An actor that calls A_VileChase and encounters a dead object with a Raise frame jumps to this frame on "heal".

Frames 477-487 (inclusive):
	On Fast Monsters, these frames get their duration halved.

Frame 799:
	For A_BrainExplode, a Rocket Projectile (Slot 34) is spawned, but immediately set to frame 799.
	It would be wise to then call A_BrainExplode at the end to make the next explosion occur at the end of the animation.

Frame 895:
	All actors jump to this when crushed.

Plasma Muzzle Flash:
	The plasma rifle's muzzle flash is called at random between [FlashFrame] and [FlashFrame]+1 on a call to A_FirePlasma.

Final Frame:
	If replaced in a DEH patch, using DeHackEd to patch an original EXE will overwrite the weapon table, due to a bug in DeHackEd 3.0
	(this is fine in source ports).
