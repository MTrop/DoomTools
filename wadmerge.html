WadMerge v1.8.0 by Matt Tropiano (using DoomStruct v2.14.2)
Usage: wadmerge [--help | -h | --version]
                [switches] [scriptfile] [arguments]

    --help        Prints help and exits.
    -h

    --version     Prints version, and exits.

    --gui         Starts the GUI version of this program.

[switches]:
    --verbose     Prints verbose output.
    -v

[scriptfile]:
    &lt;filename&gt;    The input script file.

    --            Script input is from Standard In, not a file.

    If a file is not specified, .&#x2F;wadmerge.txt is the default file.
    The parent directory of the provided script becomes the working directory.

[arguments]:
    The arguments to pass to the script. Script arguments are injected into
    commands by just adding &quot;$&quot; plus the argument index. (e.g. $0) A
    doubled-up $ ($$) is interpreted as one &quot;$&quot;.

    The argument index references can be in any part of the parsed tokens, not
    just by themselves as a singular token. They are parsed at the token level,
    not the line level.

    Arguments: [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;doom stuff&quot;]
    mergedir $1 .&#x2F;$0&#x2F;$1phone $2
    Expands to:
    mergedir &quot;banana&quot; &quot;.&#x2F;apple&#x2F;bananaphone&quot; &quot;doom stuff&quot;

...............

END
    Ends script read.

ECHO [...]
    Prints tokens to output.
    [...]: The tokens to print.

CREATE [symbol] [opt:iwad]
    Creates a new in-memory buffer, errors out if the symbol exists.
    Buffers are best used for speed, but large merges will consume
    lots of memory during merge.
    [symbol]: The symbol for the new buffer.
    [iwad]:   (Optional) If &quot;iwad&quot;, the created WAD file is an IWAD.
    ................................

    the symbol exists or the new file could not be created.
    WARNING: If the file already exists, it is OVERWRITTEN!

    ................................
    Returns: OK if successful.
             BAD_SYMBOL if the symbol is invalid.

SAVE [symbol] [file]

    the file, if they don&#39;t exist. If the symbol is a WAD file (not buffer)
    and the destination is the same file, nothing happens.
    WARNING: If the target file already exists, it is OVERWRITTEN!
    [symbol]: The symbol to export.

    WARNING: If the target file already exists, it is OVERWRITTEN!
    [symbol]: The symbol to export.

FILECHARSUB [char] [replacement]

    used in file names in your filesystem.
    For example: &quot;VILE^1.lmp&quot; will import as &quot;VILE\1&quot; if the following
    was set:
        FILECHARSUB ^ \
    [char]:        The character to replace (first character is used).
    [replacement]: The replacement character (first character is used).
